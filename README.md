# CS 2340 Codestyle

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker runtime (i.e. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))

**TODO** write getting started instructions

## â„¹ About

### Rationale

Standardizing code style within group projects is important for a multitude of reasons. Besides making code easier for TA graders to read & comprehend, enforcing consistent code style is beneficial for group membersâ€”ensuring all members can read and write code with consistent style/layout.

### Software

Students have the option to use either Python Flask or Java Swing to write their group projects with, so style checkers are provided for each option separately.

#### Python - `pylint`

Python code style is checked using [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/), which enforces [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines, widely regarded as best style practices in Python.

##### Installation

Once Python/`pip` are installed as a part of installing the required software to develop using Flask, Pylint can be installed by using pip:

```bash
pip install pylint
```
